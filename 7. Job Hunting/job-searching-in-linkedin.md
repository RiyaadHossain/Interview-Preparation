## Additional Tips
1. Many Good Companies don't reply on job portals rather they pranotize referrals -> search for such companies and connect with their employee for referral
2. Many recruiters don't create job post(require premeum membership) rather make a general Post in LinkedIn -> try searching by "software engineer" "hiring"
3. Connect with the relevant user (hr, senior engineer, employee) found in job posting
4. Search with "talent acquisition specialist", filter location connect with recruiter and ask for opportunites

# 🚀 LinkedIn Job Search Strategy

## 🔍 1. Finding the Right People to Connect With  
- **Run a blank search** → Click **Search bar** → Press **Enter**.  
- Select **Posts** → Click **All Filters** → Choose **Author Company**.  
- Add **target companies** → Show **Results**.  
- Now, you see **active LinkedIn users** from those companies.  

## 🎯 2. Who to Engage With?  
Look for:  
1. **Recruiters** (job title includes “Recruiter”).  
2. **People with "I’m Hiring" on their profile picture**.  
3. **New employees who recently started at that company**.  

## 💬 3. Leaving Meaningful Comments  
- **Engage with 5 posts daily** for **2 weeks**.  
- Avoid generic **“Congrats”** comments. Instead, ask:  
  - *"What's one thing that helped you land this role?"*  
- This increases **visibility** among recruiters & hiring managers.  

## 🎁 4. Benefits of Commenting  
✅ Gain insights from **new hires**.  
✅ **Recruiters** might check your **profile**.  
✅ Create an opportunity for a **follow-up connection request**.  

## 📩 5. Sending Connection Requests That Get Accepted  
Use this **3-step formula**:  
1. **Lead with positivity** (*"Hope you're having a great week!"*).  
2. **Show you know them** (reference their **career path, posts, or offer value**).  
3. **Ask a genuine question**.
