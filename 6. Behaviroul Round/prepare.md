## 1. Understand the STAR Method
Most behavioral questions can be answered using the **STAR framework**:
- **Situation:** Describe the context.
- **Task:** Explain your responsibility.
- **Action:** Detail what you did.
- **Result:** Share the outcome.


**Example:**  
**Q: "Tell me about a time you had to resolve a conflict in a team."**  
**A:**  
- **Situation:** In a group project, two teammates disagreed on the tech stack.  
- **Task:** As the lead, I had to ensure we made the best decision quickly.  
- **Action:** I facilitated a discussion, listing pros/cons and aligning with project goals.  
- **Result:** We agreed on a compromise, met the deadline, and delivered a successful project.
