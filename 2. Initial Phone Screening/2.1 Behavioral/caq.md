## some strengths of mine:
_"One of my key strengths is my ability to quickly learn new technologies and apply them effectively. In my last role, I was asked to work with Angular, a framework I hadn’t used before. I took a systematic approach—starting with official documentation, watched tutorials, set up a practice environment to apply what I was learning, and analyzing existing project code. Within two weeks, I was able to contribute to live projects by improving UI components and fixing bugs. This experience reinforced my adaptability and problem-solving skills in a fast-paced environment._

_Another key strength of mine is being a self-driven and independent learner. Coming from a non-CSE background, I had to take ownership of my learning journey. I proactively researched market trends, identified in-demand technologies, and set clear learning goals. To stay on track, I maintained strict discipline and productivity techniques, following structured study plans and working tirelessly to master new skills. This experience not only strengthened my technical abilities but also shaped me into an engineer who can research, plan, and execute learning strategies independently. I see this as a blessing because it has developed my ability to adapt, solve problems, and continuously improve in a structured way."_
