## "Tell me a little about yourself and your background."

*"Sure! My journey in software development started when I enrolled in a coding bootcamp, where I learned modern web technologes and built real-life projects. These hands-on experience helped me to land my first role as a backend engineer at an Indian startup, where I worked in agile projects, colloborated with cross functional team, resolved critical bugs, add new features maintaing consistency, sometimes optimizing existing systems.*

*After contributing more than one year, I realized that to grow as a software engineer, strong problem-solving skill and solid Software fundamentals are essential. So, I made the bold decision to step back from full-time work and dedicate a year to mastering data structures, algorithms, and computer science fundamentals. I enrolled in another rigorous bootcamp where I learned software development Lifecycle, OOP. Most importantly I actively participated in competitive programming, solving over 1,000 programming problems and competing in 40+ contests, which significantly improve my problem-solving mindset and sharpened my analytical thinking.*

*Beyond algorithms, I also explored system design, OOP principles, and design patterns. To put my learning into real-life senario, I built two full-stack projects with advanced authentication and dashboard features—  Jobster(a recruiting platform) and employee management system(a dashboard project). Now, with my combined experience in real-world development, problem-solving, and system design, I’m excited to bring my skills to a team where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to learn and grow."*

## some strengths of mine:
_"One of my key strengths is my ability to quickly learn new technologies and apply them effectively. In my last role, I was asked to work with Angular, a framework I hadn’t used before. I took a systematic approach—starting with official documentation, watched tutorials, set up a practice environment to apply what I was learning, and analyzing existing project code. Within two weeks, I was able to contribute to live projects by improving UI components and fixing bugs. This experience reinforced my adaptability and problem-solving skills in a fast-paced environment._

_Another key strength of mine is being a self-driven and independent learner. Coming from a non-CSE background, I had to take ownership of my learning journey. I proactively researched market trends, identified in-demand technologies, and set clear learning goals. To stay on track, I maintained strict discipline and productivity techniques, following structured study plans and working tirelessly to master new skills. This experience not only strengthened my technical abilities but also shaped me into an engineer who can research, plan, and execute learning strategies independently. I see this as a blessing because it has developed my ability to adapt, solve problems, and continuously improve in a structured way."_
