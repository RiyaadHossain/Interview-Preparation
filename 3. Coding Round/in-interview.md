## Key Takeaways

### 1. Start with a Strong Introduction
- Introduce yourself briefly (1-2 minutes) and enthusiastically.
- Smile and engage to set a positive tone.

### 2. Understand the Problem Thoroughly
- Ask clarifying questions about input/output, constraints, and edge cases.
- Paraphrase the problem to confirm understanding.
- Work through simple examples to validate your approach.

### 3. Plan and Discuss Your Approach
- Think aloud and share your thought process.
- Propose multiple approaches (brute force and optimized) and discuss trade-offs.
- Eloborate which data structure/algorithm you'll choose and why
- Agree on the best approach with the interviewer.
- State the time and space complexity of your solution.

### 4. Write Clean and Efficient Code
- Start coding only after getting approval.
- Explain your code as you write it.
- Use meaningful variable names and write modular code.
- Write necessary comments
- Ask permission to use built-in functions.

### 5. Test and Debug Your Code
- Check for mistakes (e.g., off-by-one errors, syntax issues).
- Add test cases, including edge cases, and dry run.
- Refactor if necessary and reiterate the time and space complexity.

### 6. End on a Positive Note
- Ask thoughtful questions about the role, team, or company.
- Thank the interviewer for their time.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Jumping into coding too soon**: Always clarify the problem and discuss your approach first.
- **Ignoring edge cases**: Failing to consider edge cases can lead to incomplete solutions.
- **Poor communication**: Not explaining your thought process or code can make it hard for the interviewer to follow.
- **Arguing with the interviewer**: Listen carefully to hints or feedback and adjust your approach.
- **Announcing youâ€™re done too early**: Always test and debug your code before declaring it complete.

---

## Pro Tips
- **Practice whiteboard coding**: For onsite interviews, practice writing clean, spaced-out code on a whiteboard.
- **Use shortcuts in online editors**: Familiarize yourself with the coding environment (e.g., CoderPad) and use shortcuts to save time.
- **Stay calm under pressure**: If you get stuck, take a deep breath, think aloud, and ask for hints if needed.
