## Online Assessment (OA)

### When
- Common for large tech companies (e.g., FAANG) and competitive startups.

### Format
- Coding challenges on platforms like **HackerRank**, **LeetCode**, or **CodeSignal**.
- Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on data structures, algorithms, or basic computer science concepts.

### Focus
- Problem-solving, coding skills, and speed.

### Duration
- 60-120 minutes.

### Difficulty
- Easy to Medium (LeetCode level).

---

## Behavioral Phone Screening

### When
- Early stage, conducted by an HR/recruiter.

### Format
- Informal conversation (no technical questions).

### Focus
- **About You**: Background, career goals, and motivation.
- **Work Experience**: Brief discussion of past projects and roles.
- **Cultural Fit**: How well you align with the company's values and culture.

### Common Questions
- "Tell me about yourself."
- "Why do you want to work here?"
- "Describe a challenging project and how you handled it."

### Duration
- 15-30 minutes.

---

## Technical Phone Screening

### When
- Typically conducted by an engineer.

### Format
- Live coding via platforms like **CoderPad** or **Google Meet**.

### Focus
- Core algorithms (arrays, strings, recursion, dynamic programming).
- Data structures (hashmaps, trees, graphs).
- Optimization techniques.

### Difficulty
- Medium (LeetCode level).

### Duration
- 30-60 minutes.

---

## Coding Rounds

### When
- Onsite or virtual technical rounds; typically 1-3 sessions.

### Format
- Solve 2-3 coding problems per round.

### Focus
- Advanced DSA (graphs, DP, sliding window, etc.).
- Problem-solving speed, clean code, and testing.

### Duration
- 45-60 minutes per round.

## System Design Round

### When
- Mostly for mid-to-senior levels; sometimes for junior roles with 1-2 years of experience.

### Format
- Open-ended discussion to design a scalable and robust system.

### Focus
- **High-Level Design**: Breaking down the system into modules.
- Scalability, fault tolerance, and trade-offs.
- Use of appropriate databases, caching, APIs, and load balancing.

### Preparation
- Learn basics of distributed systems.
- Study system design books (e.g., "Designing Data-Intensive Applications").

### Duration
- 45-60 minutes.

## Behavioral Round

### When
- Towards the end, often conducted by the hiring manager or a senior engineer.

### Format
- Scenario-based questions.

### Focus
- Leadership, teamwork, and conflict resolution.
- Ability to collaborate with diverse teams.

### Common Questions
- "Tell me about a time you faced a technical challenge and how you resolved it."
- "How do you prioritize tasks when working on multiple projects?"
- "Describe a situation where you had a conflict with a team member."

### Duration
- 30-45 minutes.

---

## Team Selection/Salary Negotiation

### When
- Final stage, post-offer acceptance.

### Format
- **Team Selection**: Meet potential teammates or managers to align on interests and goals.
- **Package Negotiation**: Finalize compensation, benefits, and joining date.

### Focus
- Ensuring alignment with the team.
- Negotiating a competitive package (salary, equity, perks).

### Tips
- Research market compensation using tools like **Levels.fyi** or **Glassdoor**.
- Be clear about your priorities (salary, work-life balance, growth).
