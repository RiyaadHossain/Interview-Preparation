## Online Assessment (OA)

**When:** Common for large tech companies (e.g., FAANG) and competitive startups.

#### Format
- Coding challenges on platforms like **HackerRank**, **LeetCode**, or **CodeSignal**.
- Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on data structures, algorithms, or basic computer science concepts.

**Focus:** Problem-solving, coding skills, and speed.

**Duration:** 60-120 minutes.

**Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (LeetCode level).

---

## Initial Phone Screening

**When:** Early stage, conducted by an HR/recruiter or an engineer.

#### Behavioral Screening
- Informal conversation (no technical questions).
- **Focus:** Background, career goals, cultural fit.
- **Duration:** 15-30 minutes.
- **Common Questions:** [CAQ](./6.%20Behaviroul%20Round/caq.md)

#### Technical Screening
- Live coding via platforms like **CoderPad** or **Google Meet**.
- **Focus:** Core algorithms (arrays, strings, recursion, dynamic programming), data structures (hashmaps, trees, graphs), optimization techniques.
- **Duration:** 30-60 minutes.
- **Difficulty:** Medium (LeetCode level).

---

## Coding Rounds

**When:** Onsite or virtual technical rounds; typically 1-3 sessions.

#### Format
- Solve 2-3 coding problems per round.

**Focus:** Advanced DSA (graphs, DP, sliding window, etc.), problem-solving speed, clean code, and testing.

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes per round.

## Maching Coding/Low-Level Design Round

**When:** For roles requiring strong software design and object-oriented programming skills.

#### Format
- Discussion on designing a class-based system with OOP principles.

**Focus:** Object-oriented design, design patterns, SOLID principles, and efficient code structuring.

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes.

---

## System Design Round

**When:** Mostly for mid-to-senior levels; sometimes for junior roles with 1-2 years of experience.

#### Format
- Open-ended discussion to design a scalable and robust system.

**Focus:** High-level system design, scalability, fault tolerance, trade-offs, appropriate databases, caching, APIs, and load balancing.

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes.

## Behavioral Round

**When:** Towards the end, often conducted by the hiring manager or a senior engineer.

#### Format
- Scenario-based questions.

**Focus:** Leadership, teamwork, and conflict resolution.

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes.

## Team Selection/Salary Negotiation

**When:** Final stage, post-offer acceptance.

#### Format
- **Team Selection:** Meet potential teammates or managers to align on interests and goals.
- **Package Negotiation:** Finalize compensation, benefits, and joining date.

**Focus:** Ensuring alignment with the team and negotiating a competitive package (salary, equity, perks).

**Tips:**
- Research market compensation using tools like **Levels.fyi** or **Glassdoor**.
- Be clear about your priorities (salary, work-life balance, growth).
